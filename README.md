## What is Sandboxie-Plus?

**Sandboxie-Plus** is a sophisticated and highly reliable open-source application designed to create isolated execution environments on Windows systems. It enables users to run programs within a protected space, commonly referred to as a sandbox, which separates and contains all operations performed by the software. This means that any changes made within the sandbox—such as file creations, registry modifications, or system adjustments—do not affect the host operating system.

This application is particularly valuable for individuals and organizations seeking to enhance their cybersecurity posture, conduct software evaluations, or maintain a clean and stable computing environment. Sandboxie-Plus builds upon the legacy of the original Sandboxie project with modern improvements, extended functionality, and support for contemporary Windows platforms including Windows 10 and Windows 11.

Users benefit from a seamless experience that combines robust security with operational flexibility. The interface is intuitive enough for beginners, while offering deep customization for advanced users who wish to tailor sandbox policies, resource access, and network rules.

Whether you are a developer testing new code, a support technician diagnosing software issues, or a everyday user concerned about online privacy, Sandboxie-Plus provides a trustworthy and efficient solution for running applications in a secure and confined manner.
